# 5 First Principles Innovation

### 5.1 Drive game-changing innovation and continuous improvement.

Everyone wants to feel special, and at the same time, everyone wants to belong to something, to some group. So how can we be special, intrinsically different from everything else, and simultaneously be in a group of common traits? Change the game. Be unique in your group. Be different and turn new ideas into new actions. Try and fail. Try again. Have a beginner's mind where every day is a unique opportunity to learn, improve, and go a step further. Do this with others, your family, friends, and team. Instill a continuous improvement mindset until it becomes completely automatic. If you do this, you belong to a minority group of innovators, game changers, and creative leaders. Those who initiate change can have a better opportunity to manage the transition. It's inevitable. Be that force.

### 5.2 Show deep curiosity.

People love to be correct. Often, they are not. People feel that their business is unique, different, and special from others. Often, it's not. Stay curious and learn that there's more than one way of doing things, much better ways. There are interested people everywhere, and perhaps the challenge you have in front of you already has been solved by someone else. Create informal groups, establish personal connections, and get along with other curious people like yourself. Inquisitive people shine everywhere and glow when they make a discovery. Gather your team, show a deep curiosity about their work, and implement what you have learned. Be like a toddler learning how to walk.

### 5.3 Turn ideas into pragmatic, customer-focused solutions.

If you think that you exist for yourself, you would be mistaken. Your customer is the reason why you exist. You may be brilliant, or your team may come up with excellent ideas, but if you turn those ideas into something the customer can understand, grab and value, it's only a good use of time and talent. The customer is the center of everything you and your team do. So be bold, listen carefully, and give the customer the best experience that you can have. Value the customer and enable him to be the CEO of his own life. He'll thank you, and you'll thank him.

### 5.4 Help others adapt to change.

I hope that this book on these short essays enables change in your life. Keep it around, show it to others, and turn it into your actions that you have read here. Everyone feels discomfort when facing change, and so do you. However, now, you are better prepared. So, start now, help others, and be the real CEO that every company should have, and every employee should have as a leader. Lead yourself to the best you can do and enable others to do the same. Be kind and keep moving forward. You are already there. Thank you, and be the best you can be.
