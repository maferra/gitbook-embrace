# Embrace

This book is a collection of short essays. It was written in 2019 when I relocated from Lisbon to London with my family. These are the lessons that I took at age 38, my cookbook of recipes to build the proper mindset to overcome challenges. So, I hope you like it, and I wish the reader the best of luck in being successful on the biggest project of them - all life itself.
