# 1 Lead Authentically

### 1.1 Leave your ego at the door.

External factors like other people or circumstances don't cause problems. Problems stem from our attitudes, selfishness, and self-absorption. You are correct if, after reading the last sentence, you think it's an oversimplification and that some problems originate externally. Nonetheless, it is pretentious to think that we have control over external events, even if we sometimes feel we have control over them. On top of that, people tend to have loss aversion â€“ given the same conditions, there is a natural tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. So, every day, and especially when things get rough and unconformable, we must embrace humility, lead authentically, and have confidence in our abilities. Create yourself and be yourself.

### 1.2 Speak up and make the tough calls.

Finding the proper words to describe what we have in our minds is difficult. Perhaps we are rude. Perhaps we are overreacting. We may have not understood the situation well enough. The truth is that we are always overly harsh or polite. We are always over-reacting or under-reacting. If you believe you can fully understand and act perfectly according to the situation, be prepared to be frustrated and disappointed. No one can do so. So, the next logical step is to speak up and learn from your actions and reactions. If you speak up and act, you have accomplished more and given more of yourself to society. In the long run, and in the end, everyone benefits.

### 1.3 Learn from your mistakes.

You are accountable for yourself, not others. We continuously make, consciously or unconsciously, judgments about other people. It's how we compare, understand, and react accordingly. We blame others as an excuse for ourselves. We blame ourselves as an excuse for others. We see the mistake as the root cause, something that shouldn't have happened, an obstacle that shouldn't be there. However, it is when mistakes happen that people can learn. The unfortunate outcome that just happened is Nature's way of creating the proper environment for growth. Embrace the mistake, and if at first it's challenging to accept and celebrate it, at least see it as a learning opportunity. Smile and appreciate the mistake. It's pointless to blame others, and it doesn't change anything in the end. Take responsibility, take your conclusions, learn, and move on.

### 1.4 Trust, integrity, respect and empathy.

Trust is the confidence in or dependence on a person. Integrity is the practice of being honest and consistently adhering to strong moral and ethical principles and values. Everyone is different, and if someone's thoughts or actions seem odd, consider that perhaps you seem strange to someone else, too. Everyone thinks that they are correct, and most people have good intentions. To build meaningful relationships, you must create a proper environment. It takes consciousness and energy to do it. Choose your relationships. Sometimes things are easy to do, and sometimes they are hard, but if your relationship is strong enough based on these values, whatever happens, everyone benefits.
