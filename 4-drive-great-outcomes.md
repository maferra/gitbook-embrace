# 4 Drive Great Outcomes

### 4.1 Deliver exceptional outcomes.

If we could establish an imaginary line between the quality of outcomes that people deliver and another line with their true potential, we would see a gigantic gap between the two. Most of that gap comes from a mere lack of awareness. Our body has more strength than we think, and our minds can comprehend more things than we believe. We only need to know the desired results to deliver exceptional outcomes and focus our time and energy on achieving them. As soon as we find ourselves doing the same routine and feeling that we are not having what we would call an exceptional result, we should stop, be aware of it, and start again. Do this every day, and while doing so, show others how you do it. Show them the benefits, exemplify awareness, and expect nothing less than genuinely brilliant results. Be aware and be positive with everyone around you.

### 4.2 Make bold decisions.

Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, to the future. Perhaps an overly complicated statement to tell the obvious - time is counting. Waiting for something to happen is putting ourselves in the hands of fate or the hands of others. Turn into a daily habit of making conscious decisions about everything. Be ambitious when doing so. Create challenges for yourself and accept the challenges that others give to you. Every opportunity arrives at the perfect time to exercise the skill of decision-making. Sometimes we make the wrong decision. Other times, you'll wonder if you could have done it another way. Be serious-minded and analyze what you could have done better. Learn from it and move forward. Doing this pushes you to uncharted territories, and you can create more opportunities for success. Keep moving forward.

### 4.3 Voice your opinion and listen entirely.

It's hard to find and discuss facts, but it's easy to discuss opinions. Even more, if they carry emotional content and people heartedly believe in that specific point of view. All ideas are rooted in subjective matters without conclusive findings. By figures of authority, by role models, or by just bullying, you may feel more comfortable not expressing your opinions. If you do this, the world loses. Perhaps the views of others are more distant from the truth than yours. Or their knowledge may not be as good as yours. Either way, if you don't express your view, everyone loses an opportunity for growth. So, speak up, and always listen back. Encourage others to do the same and try to reach an understanding of the problem. Even if, in the end, you don't arrive at a definite conclusion, the world can still be a better place. Don't stay in silence.

### 4.4 Set ambitious goals.

Every time you change a rule, you get a different result. So, think before complaining about the results. Being ambitious requires clear expectations for yourself and others. Everyone sees things from a different perspective. Find common ground to lay out the rules and be bold about the results you and your team should accomplish. Tell them how you view the path to those results. Listen to what they say. Adjust your view and define the rules as a team. Show that you are the first to abide by those rules. If you remember the legendary King Arthur's Round Table, you'll know that the table has no head, implying that everyone there has equal status. There is no king seating at the table. Establish the measurement system, discuss it, be accountable, and set ambitious goals for you and your team.
